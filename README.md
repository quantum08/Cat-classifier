# Cat-classifier
This is a implementation of the method and algorithm that predict whether the image is cat or not . there is a file dataset.py which consist of the dataset of cat image divide in two part one is train_dataset which train the model and other is test_dataset which is use to predict the accuracy of our model .                                                                                                                                        There is another file LogisticRegression.py which consist of our main code in which we create a model on different iteration and learning rate . 
# DEPENDENCIES :-
1. numpy
2. scipy
3. matplotlib
4. PIL


To test on your image just put your image in the test folder under the name "image" in jpg format
